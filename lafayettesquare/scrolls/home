# [Chaos](https://github.com/LafeLabs/chaos/)


A self-replicating text-based mixed reality game for mutual aid.

*from each according to their ability to each according to their need*

## How to play:

1. choose a scroll, follow a scroll to a place
2. complete the quest for that place
3. replicate the game(create new quest)

## To replicate the game:

1. choose a name for a space about a mile across
2. go find a shared public place(about the size of a street corner or bus stop) in that space, give it a name
3. write a quest to help the community in that place specifically
4. give place and quest to an operator, who will write a scroll, post it and give you the address
5. create white rabbit for the scroll and distribute

## Space: Lafayette Square

This is the green space just North of the White House, and just South of Black Lives Matter Plaza and H Street.  The nearest metro stations are Farragut North(red line) and Farragut West(blue/orange/silver).
