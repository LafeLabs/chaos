# trashcore

trashcore is fashion based on trash, with a rainbow and googly eye aesthetic.  In spite of being directly at the seat of power of the most powerful government on the planet, this place is full of trash.  Go find some trash.  Turn it into trashcore fashion and sell it, then donate proceeds back to someone in the park who looks like they could use the cash.
