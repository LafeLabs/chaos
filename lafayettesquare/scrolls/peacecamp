# peacecamp

at the center and edge of the green space, facing toward the Whitehouse is a tent which has been there for several decades, supposedly since the 1980s.  Go talk to the people in the tent. Learn what they are talking about right now, what they think the most important issues are.  Ask them if they want any snacks, then go get snacks and bring them back to the camp.
