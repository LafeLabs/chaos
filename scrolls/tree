# tree

Great wide tree prvides shade while overlooking US Highway 29 on the southbound side, directly off the parking lot for Cherry Tree shopping center.  Tree is directly across the driveway from the pho restaurant.

Marker is at base of tree.

This tree is a fantastic place to relax while watching the traffic go by, as the tree provides shelter in all weather.  It is easy to climb up and sit in as well.

To go to the manhole, walk from the tree just a few paces toward the exit of the shopoing center and look in the grass for a heavy cast iron manhole with the symbol for the Bell System on it.
