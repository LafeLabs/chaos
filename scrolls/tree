# tree

Great wide trees prvide shade while overlooking US Highway 29 on the southbound side, directly off the parking lot for Cherry Tree shopping center.  Trees are directly across the driveway from the pho restaurant.


This trees are a fantastic place to relax while watching the traffic go by, as the tree provides shelter in all weather.  It is easy to climb up and sit in as well.


The Manhole is near the tree, down away from the highway toward the dumpster.
