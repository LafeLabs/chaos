# [Chaos](https://github.com/LafeLabs/chaos/)

A self-replicating text-based mixed reality game for mutual aid.

## How to play:

1. follow the scroll to the place
2. complete the quest
3. replicate the game

## To replicate the game:

1. choose a name for a space about a mile across
2. go find a shared public place(about the size of a street corner or bus stop) in that space, give it a name
3. write a quest to help the community in that place specifically
4. give place and quest to an operator, who will write a scroll, post it and give you the address
5. create white rabbit for the scroll and distribute

## Spaces:

 - [maplelawn](maplelawn/)
 - [kstreet](https://www.kstreet.xyz)

## Scrolls:

 - [home](scrolls/home) 

## Become an Operator

[To replicate the system read the README file](scroll(README.md))
