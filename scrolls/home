A self-replicating text-based mixed reality game to make this place right here better.

## How to play:

## To replicate the game:

1. choose a name for a space about a mile across
1. go find a shared public place in that space, give it a name
2. write a quest to make that place better
3. give place and quest to an operator, who will write a scroll, post it and give you the address
4. create white rabbit for the scroll, distribute it

## Spaces:

 - [maplelawn](maplelawn/)
 - [kstreet](https://www.kstreet.xyz)
