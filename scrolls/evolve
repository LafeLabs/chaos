# evolve

All documents can be edited by all people at all time.

to edit the scrolls, use scroll editor at [scrolleditor.php](scrolleditor.php?scroll=scrolls/evolve).

to edit all the other code on this server, use [editor.php](editor.php).

Editor.php can edit ALL code on the server, including itself and the other PHP scripts, but it edits .txt copies in the "php/" directory to avoid instant destruction of files while they're used. To convert all those .txt files into .php files in the main web directory run:

[text2php.php](text2php.php)

To make a new file, use editor.php?newfile=[filename].
