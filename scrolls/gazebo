# gazebo

From the intersection of eastern market and maple lawn boulevard go to the opposite side of the street from Looneys pub then away from Maryland 216 to the right if you just crossed from looney or left if you came from the BP. 

Go passed two big buildings and the dead bank or about 220 paces then another 100 paces past the dead bank to get to the entrance to the PA path.  

Go down the paved path about 15 paces to the first fork then fork right and go 30 yards to the gazebo.  
 
Marker in center of hexagon until we get a seat.
