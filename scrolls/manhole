**What is the legacy of the Bell System?**
    
# manhole

The manhole is at the entrance to the Cherry Tree Shopping Center in Fulton MD, at the intersection of Maryland 216 and US 29.  The manhole is right at the turn near the pho place, just in from the curb near the highest point of the driveway.  It is on the bluff up above US 29 southbound.

This manhole is a relic of the Bell System.  Note the hexagons of the Bell System and the Bell logo.  The sheer size of the Bell system boggles the mind. It was an empire unto itself.  It created Bell Labs, one of the most productive institutions of applied science ever built.  And now it is all chaos.

We are phreaks in a network which exists only in our minds.  We phreak the old networks by pure symbolic manipulation.


The dumpster is just down the hill along the driveway toward the main road, and the tree is across the grass toward the highway.
