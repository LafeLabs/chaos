# woods

Secret nook in the woods along the road from the traffic circle off of MD 216 to the Cherry Tree shopping center.  Walk about 40 paces from the end of the sidewalk off of the traffic circle, and look carefully into the woods until you see a giant round steel manhole.  Marker is on manhole.

Keep going toward the Cherry Tree shopping center to get to the Dumpster or go farther down the road away from Cherry Tree past the exit toward the traffic circle to the dead end.
