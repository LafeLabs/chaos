# woods

Secret nook in the woods.

From the traffic circle along Maryland route 216 which exits to the Cherry Tree Shopping Center(visible from US 29), walk toward Buch Way, the street which connects to the shopping center, on the right side of the little connector, until you get to the end of the sidewalk, then walk right along the road for about 40 paces, and look to the right into the woods.  There is a little hole in the woods which goes into a giant manhole cover.  That is the place.
