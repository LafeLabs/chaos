*what is the magic of this place?*
    
# treegrotto

From the gazebo go back 30 yards to the top fork.  Take the very hard right to head downhill along the paved trail away from the road.  Proceed down 55 yards to the second fork on the paved trail. Fork left. Go 5 more yards. Turn left and walk directly down the grassy hill in a direction perpendicular to the paved trail toward the trees, go 10 yards until into the shelter of a tree which creates a natural dome structure. 

The place is behind the trunk of the main tree. Drop a thing leave a thing. Drop a message leave a message.
