# deadend

From the exit from Maryland route 216 to the Cherry Tree shopping center, turn left down Buch road which dead ends.  The center signpost is the marker, the specific exact place which is "deadend".  From the BP station in Maple Lawn, scramble up the little embankment and look to the end of the road, you can get to this place from there as well.

There is no shade here.  There are no paths.  No homes, no businesses, and it's not really a park.  What is it?
