# dumpster

If none of this is recycled, why is it here? Who dumps all this? Where does it go? Who cleans it up? How many people are scavenging from here and what do they do with it? 

In the world we are building, there will be no mines. There will be dumps.  We will live in on and around the dump, as it is the eternal fountain of free things.

Marker is to the far left on the ground when facing the row of painted metal boxes.

Go up toward the shopping center to get to the manhole and tree

Or head toward the main road to find your way to the secret nook in the woods.
