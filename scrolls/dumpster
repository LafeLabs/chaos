# dumpster

This is not really a dumpster.  But it would also be wrong to call it a "donation" place.  It's more of a generic illegal dump zone.  From Maryland 216, take the exit for the Cherry Tree shopping center, turn right into Buch Way, and go all the way down to the corner and there is a row of white boxes.  

If none of this is recycled, why is it here? Who dumps all this? Where does it go? Who cleans it up? How many people are scavenging from here and what do they do with it? 

In the world we are building, there will be no mines. There will be dumps.  We will live in on and around the dump, as it is the eternal fountain of free things.

Explore in detail the things.  There is trash magic here.  Learn to feel the power of the trash.
