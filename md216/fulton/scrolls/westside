*why is there not more public space here?*
    
# westside

The traffic circle which connects westside boulevard, Maryland route 216 and old columbia road which goes up to the park and ride and the church.  This is the traffic circle closest to the CVS.


This is in many ways the real heart of a community.  There is a lot of food, medicine, snacks, many basic elements of life. Many people work here, many people live here, multiple religious institutions connect here and a whole other leg of the roads down the hill to the south.  But there is no park, no bench, no gazebo, no shelter.  Just weirdly broken and useless space.  This must be fixed.  There should be places to sit in the shade, with views and outlooks. There should be shelters, and sheltered boxes to exchange things and messages with other members of the community.

From here you can go east toward the Maple Lawn Bouleverd Traffic circle.
