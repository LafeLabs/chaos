*how can we connect the people passing through this circle every day?*
    
# icecrystal

This is a four way traffic circle, with an exit to Ice Crystal Drive, an exit to an entrance to US 29, and the pass through for Maryland Route 216.  

A huge number of people go through here every day in metal boxes and do not communicate.  Let's use this place to drop notes to each other to build a network.  Add notes to the end of the traffic noise barrier which is on the edge of the parking lot with the Dunkin donuts.
