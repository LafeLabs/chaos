*What more information should the signs here have?*
    
# scaggsville

The Cherry Tree Shopping Center, the fire and police and municipal buildings, and a dead end road(Buch) are all off of one exit from this traffic circle, the opposite side is an entrance to US Route 29, and the other two are Maryland Route 216.

Go to the exit toward the shopping center and note the sign on the right side of the road exiting the circle.  This is not a very good sign.  How can we make it better?

From here you can jump over to the MapleLawn.net CHAOS game, or head west to the maple lawn boulevard traffic circle or east to icecrystal.
