*how much power flows through these lines?*
    
# pylon

The pylon is reached from the [gazebo](scrolls/gazebo) by going out to Maple Lawn Boulevard and heading right after leaving the gazebo and going down about 400 yards until you get to the power line with the giant pylons.

cross the street and go about 40 to 50 yards away from Maple Lawn Boulevard to get to the top most pylon in the series, in the opposite direction from US 29, which should be down the hill behind you.  Walk through the tall grass to the base, and look on the underside, on the south side to see the marker.  Leave things under the pylon out of the way of grass cutting.
