# Lafayette Square

This is the square due North of the Whitehouse.

This is a crossroads of the world. If you've been to the Eiffel Tower, outside the Houses of Parliament, or to Times Square, this is closer to being those places than it is to an actual block in any local city space.  We will build a more freely connected world as we connect the people in each of these public spaces across the world. They are already connected in their meaning, but we need to add layers of freely replicating information.  

This square can itself become a whole network, with fractal maps.

The politicians and their staff don't really own this space mentally, they pass through in a hurry and don't really look.  But people from every corner of the world come here. 

The CHAOS game pieces are set up on a chess table just before 9 o'clock around the circle(oval) if "up" is north and going around the central fountain is a clock.

On a perfect Sunday afternoon with minimal crowds these tables remain unused.  Strange. Add game pieces until the tables are used.

From here go North and West a couple blocks to Farragut North or head West along H street toward Paul Bakery and Washington Circle.
