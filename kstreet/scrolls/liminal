# Dupont circle liminal space

At the top of the very long escalator out of the SOUTH exit to the Dupont Circle metro, cross 19th.

Where 19th and Connecticut come together on the south side of the circle directly across 19th from Krispy Kreme there is a slate embankment with four brick lined planters with small trees. 

Marker is the second planter in from the circle.

It's not quite hostile architecture  but it's sure not friendly.  You can sit by there are no seats. There is green but still way more concrete.  This is a weirdly liminal space with no clear logic.  How could we give this place meaning?

From here, you can go down south and west along New Hampshire to get to Washington Circle or south and east along Connecticut Avenue to get to Farragut North.
