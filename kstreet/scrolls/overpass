*how much longer will this oil pipeline flow?*
    
*how much longer will this concrete canyon of oil burning machines keep running?*

*how will it end?*

*will we kill ourselves with oil or choose another way before that point?*  

# Washington Circle

Go to the due East end of Washington Circle, and you will see a overlook into a concrete canyon which contains K street.  Look down. Gaze on it! This is the essence of our civilization: burning oil to push machines through concrete.  Plenty of space is here for this flow of killer machines, but not enough space for everyone to sleep indoors.  

Marker is to the right when facing out over the highway overlook, just around the corner, on the wall.  

If someone is outside the shelter, say hello and give them some money if they seem friendly.  Be polite and respectful, and do not film.  They probably do not know about CHAOS yet, feel free to discuss it.  

From here you can go East and South along Pennsylvania toward Paul Bakery and and Lafayette Square or north and east along New Hampshire Avenue to Dupont Circle.
