# Paul Bakery

Paul Bakery on 20th street just south of Pennsylvania Avenue.  These are some of the best pastries anywhere, and the outdoor seating is fantastic in several DC locations.  

Marker is on outdoor seating far left when facing the street see the yellow metal guard rail marker is inside the metal.  Messages can probably be left in this space pretty safely as it's hard to notice unless you are really looking for it.

From Paul, you can either continue down South and East along Pennsylvania Avenue until you get to H street, and take H over to Lafayette Square, head the other way until you get back to Washington Circle, or head North along 20th until you get to New Hampshire Avenue and go to Dupont Circle.
