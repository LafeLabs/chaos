*How can we build more connections between the Farraguts?*    

# Farragut North

The two Faraggut stations are absurdly close and yet do not touch.  It is what it is.  But what could we do to build physical social network infrastructure with physical media between the two? How might this benefit the people occupying both spaces?  What are the differences?

Follow the signs to the k street exit from the Farragut north metro station. 

Turn right at the top of the escalator and cross half way across Connecticut Avenue to the island by the cylindrical red sculpture.  See the placard and take a triangle. 

From here you can go South a couple blocks and a block east to Lafayette Square, just north of the whitehouse, north and west along Connecticut Avenue to Dupont Circle, or due West along k street to Washington circle.
